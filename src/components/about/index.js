                The idea behind The Journey Hub came when co-founders Oliver and
                Richard found themselves spending hours in the car, thanks to
                the talents of the children from both families. With Hannah and
                Jaedon excelling at tennis and football respectively, the dads
                each found themselves travelling to training grounds four days a
                week, as well as matches at weekends.

                After so much time in the car, it because obvious that train
                travel would be preferable, allowing the children to get on with
                things like homework, and the adults to ditch their cars.
                Unfortunately, there simply wasn’t adequate public transport to
                complete the journey from beginning to end - and so The
                Passenger Hub was born.

                While train travel is at its core, the secret ingredient is the
                addition of micromobility - shared use vehicles, designed for
                short trips and low speeds. The goal is for commutes, leisure
                journeys and, of course, training runs, to become cheaper,
                greener and more seamless.

                tickets. But this is just the beginning. With the addition of
